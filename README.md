# AuraVision
AuraVision (AV) is a real-time speech-to-text demo tool designed to help the deaf and hard-of-hearing community by converting spoken words into text. This demo runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac PCs and supports English, Spanish, and Farsi. The final product will be built with Vosk and Raspberry Pi for hardware deployment.
